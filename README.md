# Prerequisites
[IPython notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) is used to demonstrate the exercises, but any IDE can be used to implement them, for example [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).  
To install python-igraph execute:  `$ pip install python-igraph`

[python-igraph](http://igraph.org/python/) is used to perform graph operations, see [tutorial](http://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/tutorial.html) and [API manual](http://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.GraphBase-class.html).
